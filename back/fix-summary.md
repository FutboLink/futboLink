# Stripe Payment Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **API Version Mismatch**
   - Updated the API version from `2023-10-16` to `2025-02-24.acacia` to match the version used by Stripe

2. **HTTP Agent Configuration**
   - Fixed the HTTP agent to properly use HTTPS instead of HTTP
   - Used the correct `https.Agent` instead of `http.Agent`
   - Enhanced agent with production-specific settings (keepAliveMsecs, maxSockets)

3. **Connection Settings**
   - Increased timeout from 30 seconds to 60 seconds (120 seconds in production)
   - Increased max retries from 5 to 7 (10 in production)
   - Added proper keep-alive settings for the connection

4. **Production Environment Handling**
   - Added environment detection to apply stronger settings in production
   - Implemented exponential backoff retry mechanism for Stripe operations
   - Added fallback mechanisms for handling network issues in production
   - Created fallback price ID list to use when Stripe API is unreachable

## Testing Done

1. **Price ID Verification**
   - Confirmed all frontend price IDs exist in Stripe account
   - Verified the product IDs are correctly linked to prices
   - Added explicit tests for production Stripe connectivity

2. **Connectivity Testing**
   - Direct HTTPS connection to Stripe API works
   - DNS resolution for api.stripe.com successful
   - Successfully created a test checkout session
   - Added enhanced diagnostics for production environments

3. **Subscription Flow Testing**
   - Verified creating checkout sessions works
   - Ensured the product and price IDs are valid
   - Added fallback mechanisms when primary price ID fails

## Implementation Changes

- Updated `stripe.service.ts` with correct API version and connection settings
- Created test scripts to verify connectivity and price ID validity
- Fixed proper HTTPS agent usage in API calls
- Added `retryStripeOperation` method with exponential backoff
- Created diagnostic scripts for production environments
- Added environment-aware configuration for optimal settings

## Diagnostic Tools Created

1. **test-server-connectivity.js**
   - Tests direct HTTPS connections to Stripe
   - Verifies DNS resolution 
   - Checks that price IDs exist in Stripe

2. **test-production-issues.js**
   - Tests multiple DNS servers for resolution
   - Checks TLS version compatibility
   - Tests network port connectivity
   - Identifies proxy environment issues
   - Performs extreme timeout testing

3. **production-setup.js**
   - Verifies required environment variables
   - Creates fallback price configuration file
   - Checks network configuration
   - Provides deployment recommendations

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Production Setup Script**
   ```
   node production-setup.js
   ```
   This will create fallback configuration and verify environment settings.

2. **Deploy the Updated Code**
   The enhanced Stripe service now includes:
   - Better retry mechanisms
   - Fallback strategies for network issues
   - Environment-specific optimization
   - Multiple layers of error handling

3. **Monitor and Validate**
   - Check logs for Stripe connection issues
   - Verify that subscriptions can be created
   - Monitor response times for API calls

If problems persist after these changes, consider:
- Network connectivity from the server to Stripe API endpoints
- Firewall settings that might be blocking outbound HTTPS connections
- DNS resolution on the server
- TLS/SSL certificate validation issues
- Proxy server configurations that might interfere with API calls

The price IDs in the frontend are valid and match those in the Stripe account.
