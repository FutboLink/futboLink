# Stripe Payment Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **API Version Mismatch**
   - Updated the API version from `2023-10-16` to `2025-02-24.acacia` to match the version used by Stripe

2. **HTTP Agent Configuration**
   - Fixed the HTTP agent to properly use HTTPS instead of HTTP
   - Used the correct `https.Agent` instead of `http.Agent`

3. **Connection Settings**
   - Increased timeout from 30 seconds to 60 seconds
   - Increased max retries from 5 to 7
   - Added proper keep-alive settings for the connection

## Testing Done

1. **Price ID Verification**
   - Confirmed all frontend price IDs exist in Stripe account
   - Verified the product IDs are correctly linked to prices

2. **Connectivity Testing**
   - Direct HTTPS connection to Stripe API works
   - DNS resolution for api.stripe.com successful
   - Successfully created a test checkout session

3. **Subscription Flow Testing**
   - Verified creating checkout sessions works
   - Ensured the product and price IDs are valid

## Implementation Changes

- Updated `stripe.service.ts` with correct API version and connection settings
- Created test scripts to verify connectivity and price ID validity
- Fixed proper HTTPS agent usage in API calls

## Next Steps

Monitor the payment processing to ensure there are no further connectivity issues. If problems persist, check the following:

1. Network connectivity from the server to Stripe API endpoints
2. Firewall settings that might be blocking outbound HTTPS connections
3. DNS resolution on the server
4. TLS/SSL certificate validation issues

The price IDs in the frontend are valid and match those in the Stripe account.
