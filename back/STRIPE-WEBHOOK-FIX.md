# Stripe Webhook Fix for FutboLink

## Issue Description

Stripe reported that the webhook endpoint at `https://futbolink-zh5d.onrender.com/stripe/webhook` is timing out, causing webhook events to fail. This affects subscription billing and checkout processing.

The main issue was:
- Webhook timeout: The endpoint was processing events synchronously, causing timeouts
- Route mismatch: The raw body parser middleware was on a different path than the actual controller

## Changes Made

1. **Created a dedicated controller for Stripe webhooks**
   - Located at `src/payments/controllers/stripe.controller.ts`
   - Implements immediate response to Stripe
   - Processes webhook events asynchronously

2. **Optimized Stripe configuration**
   - Reduced timeout settings
   - Eliminated unnecessary retries
   - Simplified HTTP client configuration

3. **Added better error handling and logging**
   - Improved verification of webhook signatures
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

4. **Fixed middleware configuration**
   - Ensured proper body parser middleware for webhook routes
   - Added support for both `/stripe/webhook` and `/payments/webhook` routes

## Testing the Fix

1. **Use the test endpoint**
   ```
   curl -X POST https://futbolink-zh5d.onrender.com/stripe/webhook-test
   ```
   This should return a successful response with a timestamp.

2. **Update Stripe Dashboard Configuration**
   1. Log in to your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
   2. Go to Developers > Webhooks
   3. Make sure your webhook endpoint is set to `https://futbolink-zh5d.onrender.com/stripe/webhook`
   4. Click "Send test webhook" to verify it works

3. **Monitor logs**
   - Watch your application logs for webhook events
   - Make sure they show "Webhook event verified" and "Successfully processed"

## Common Issues

- **CORS errors**: The CORS settings have been updated to allow Stripe requests
- **Signature verification**: Make sure `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is correctly set in environment variables
- **Timeouts**: If timeouts still occur, you may need to further optimize database operations

## Next Steps

If the fix resolves the issue, Stripe will automatically start sending webhook events successfully. If problems persist:

1. Contact Stripe support with the error logs
2. Consider further optimizing webhook handlers for specific events
3. Investigate potential database or network latency issues
